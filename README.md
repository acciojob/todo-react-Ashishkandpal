## To-Do List App Using React

The To Do App that we are going to build, will allow a user to add a task to a list of to-do items.

Once the task is added, the user will be able to delete or edit it as required. 

When user click on edit button a input field must be shown with button 'save' besides it. After clicking on save button, task must be updated.

**NOTE:**

Use classes : `add_tasks_section`,  `tasks_section`,  `task`,  `edit`,  `delete`,  `save`
